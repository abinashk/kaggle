# Using Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifier from sklearn package. The
# motivation behind choosing this classifier was that while going through
# the documentation of BernoulliNB model, I found out that its performance
# in case of text classification using word occurrence vector was good.
# And in our case the sparse binary feature matrix created by the
# vectorizer was exactly a word occurrence vector. In addition to that
# BernoulliNB was a simple model that didnâ€™t require much optimization in
# parameters.

# The prediction score(the categorization accuracy) of this model was 0.70756.
